  Query Windows 11 version 24H2 cumulative update file information. Search for
  DLLs, drivers, and system files across all patch levels. Compare file versions
  between builds, track version history, and identify what changed in each update.
  Use when: (1) investigating which Windows build introduced a file version,
  (2) comparing file changes between patches, (3) finding DLL/driver versions
  for specific builds, (4) debugging Windows update regressions, (5) user asks
  about Windows 11 24H2 files, KB updates, or build versions.

# Windows 11 24H2 Files

Query ~2M file entries across 45+ Windows 11 24H2 cumulative updates (builds 26100.863 - 26100.7705+).

## Database

Location: `~/moz_artifacts/win11_24h2_files.db`

Schema:
```
files(kb_number, release_date, build, update_type, file_name, file_version, date, time, file_size)
```

Indexes: `file_name`, `kb_number`, `build`, `file_version`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search for files
uv run scripts/query.py search ntdll.dll

# Version history for specific file
uv run scripts/query.py history ntdll.dll

# Compare two builds
uv run scripts/query.py diff 26100.6584 26100.6899

# List all patches
uv run scripts/query.py builds

# Database stats
uv run scripts/query.py stats

# Custom SQL
uv run scripts/query.py sql "SELECT DISTINCT file_version FROM files WHERE file_name='kernel32.dll' ORDER BY build"
```

## Commands

### search
Find files by name pattern (case-insensitive contains match by default).
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py search kernel          # contains "kernel"
uv run scripts/query.py search kernel32.dll --exact  # exact match
uv run scripts/query.py search .sys --limit 100
```

### history
Track how a file's version changed across all patches. Shows `*` marker when version changed.
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py history ntdll.dll
uv run scripts/query.py history tcpip.sys
```

### diff
Compare file changes between two builds. Shows added, removed, and changed files.
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py diff 26100.6584 26100.6899
uv run scripts/query.py diff 26100.2894 26100.7705 --limit 20
```

### builds
List all available patches with file counts.
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py builds
```

### sql
Run arbitrary SQL queries for complex analysis.
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py sql "SELECT file_name, COUNT(DISTINCT file_version) as versions FROM files GROUP BY file_name ORDER BY versions DESC LIMIT 20"
```

## Common Queries

Find files that changed most frequently:
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py sql "SELECT file_name, COUNT(DISTINCT file_version) as ver_count FROM files GROUP BY file_name HAVING ver_count > 10 ORDER BY ver_count DESC LIMIT 30"
```

Find all kernel-mode drivers (.sys) in a specific build:
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py sql "SELECT file_name, file_version FROM files WHERE build='26100.6584' AND file_name LIKE '%.sys' ORDER BY file_name"
```

Check if a specific file version exists:
```bash
uv run scripts/query.py sql "SELECT kb_number, build, release_date FROM files WHERE file_name='ntoskrnl.exe' AND file_version='10.0.26100.6584'"
```
